This homework was about Computer Vision fundamentals (filters, matching) and performances evaluation.

Check the [text](https://github.com/rom42pla/aml_hw1/blob/main/text.pdf) for more infos.

## How to check our results?
You can easily check the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e8uQQk0W4IZt_W05wa1c1IPVTPT36XB1#scrollTo=wBM_07sWd_81) that already contains the output of the various tasks.

Some questions that requires particular explanations are shown in a brief [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

If you prefer to run the code on your device follow these steps instead:

- clone this repo to your device: `git clone https://github.com/rom42pla/aml_hw1.git; cd aml_hw1`
- check the results of the various tasks: `cd Filtering; python filter.py; cd ../Identification; python identification.py; cd ..`

The latter will popup all the plots on screen and the standard output to the console.
